### **REAMDE**

Note: This repository stores both frontend and backend, since I was the only developer I did that for faster development. The parent directory stores the backend of the app. See Readme for parent directory for more information.

Go to frontend folder and **run _npm install_ to install all the dependencies**

After dependencies are installed you can use following commands:

**yarn start**
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

**yarn test**
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

**yarn build**
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
